**Lethal and non-lethal tissue sampling in fish for RNA-seq**

Written by Juntao Hu on November 2017

.. note:: 

   #. To avoid cross contamination, always change equipment (e.g., knife, forceps, razor) before sampling a different individual
   #. Wear mask and frequently change glove to avoid RNA being degraded by RNase
   #. Typical tissue collected from lethally sampled fish: liver, brain, heart, head kidney, skin, muscle
   #. Typical tissue collected from non-lethally sampled fish: gill, fin, blood cell, muscle, scale
   #. Minimum tissue typically required for RNA extraction: 30mg 



Lethal tissue sampling
---------------------------

#. Euthanize fish with a lethal dose of MS-222 (300 mg/L buffered with NaHCO3 to pH 7.0-7.5).
#. Perform standard dissection procedures to remove aimed tissue.

#. 

   a. If in lab, snap frozen tissue using liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until analysis.
   b. If no access to liquid nitrogen (e.g., in field), first cut tissue into slices less than 0.5 cm thick as quickly as possible, and then fully submerge the tissue piece(s) into RNAlater (Qiagen) in a tube. Store the tissue submerged in RNAlater for up to 4 weeks at 2-8°C, up to 7 days at 15-25°C, or up to 1 day at 37°C.
   
   *  For archival storage at -20°C, first incubate the tissue overnight in the reagent at 2-8°C. Then transfer the tissue, in the reagent, to -20°C for storage.``
   *  For archival storage at -80°C, first incubate the tissue overnight in the reagent at 2-8°C. Then remove the tissue from the reagent, and transfer it to -80°C for storage.``


For non-lethal tissue sampling
-------------------------------

#. Anaesthetize fish with a non-lethal dose of MS-222 (100 mg/L buffered with NaHCO3 to pH 7.0-7.5).

#. 

   a. If using blood cell, removing ~3 mL of blood from the caudal vessel using a vacutainer syringe (3.8 cm [1.5 inches], 21 gauge). Immediately centrifuged blood sample for 7 min at 7000 ×g. Following step 3a above for storage.
   b. If using gill, removing <4 mm from the tips of 6 to 8 filaments (0.3 g) from the first gill arch.
   c. If using muscle, gently remove scales from the area on one side of the fish using a knife. Obtain the muscle sample from the dorsal musculature beneath the anterior dorsal fin with a 5-mm (diameter) disposable biopsy punch. Treat wound with Fish Bandage and Betadine antisepic solution.
   d. If using fin, cut off caudal fin near base, and the right pectoral fin (if needed). Put them into a clean tube.

#. Store samples following the step 3a or 3b above.
